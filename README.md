## ⚠️ Important Disclaimers

### **Development and Planning Only**
- All scripts are **examples and proof-of-concepts** only
- **Never run scripts against production systems** without thorough testing
- **Always test in development environments** first
- **Review and modify scripts** for your specific environment requirements

### **Infrastructure Considerations**
- Schema changes should be reviewed by database administrators
- Deployment scripts require environment-specific configuration
- Security settings must be validated for production environments
- Performance testing required before production deployment

### **Security Requirements**
- All credentials must be properly encrypted in production
- Database access should follow least-privilege principles  
- API endpoints require proper authentication and authorization
- Audit logging must be enabled for compliance requirements
